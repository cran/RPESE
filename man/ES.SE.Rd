\usage{
ES.SE(data, p = 0.95, se.method = c("IFiid", "IFcor", "IFcorAdapt",
  "IFcorPW", "BOOTiid", "BOOTcor")[1:2], cleanOutliers = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data of returns for one or multiple assets or portfolios.}

\item{p}{Confidence level for calculation. Default value is p=0.95.}

\item{se.method}{A character string indicating which method should be used to compute
the standard error of the estimated standard deviation. One or a combination of:
\code{"IFiid"} (default), \code{"IFcor"} (default), \code{"IFcorPW"}, \code{"IFcorAdapt"},
\code{"BOOTiid"} or \code{"BOOTcor"}.}

\item{cleanOutliers}{Boolean variable to indicate whether the pre-whitenning of the influence functions TS should be done through a robust filter.}

\item{fitting.method}{Distribution used in the standard errors computation. Should be one of "Exponential" (default) or "Gamma".}

\item{freq.include}{Frequency domain inclusion criteria. Must be one of "All" (default), "Decimate" or "Truncate."}

\item{freq.par}{Percentage of the frequency used if \code{"freq.include"} is "Decimate" or "Truncate." Default is 0.5.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}

\value{
A vector or a list depending on \code{se.method}.
}
\description{
\code{ES.SE} computes the standard error of the expected shortfall of the returns.
}
\note{
The option to \code{invert} the ES measure should appease both
academics and practitioners.  The mathematical definition of ES as the
negative value of extreme losses will (usually) produce a positive number.
Practitioners will argue that ES denotes a loss, and should be internally
consistent with the quantile (a negative number).  For tables and charts,
different preferences may apply for clarity and compactness.  As such, we
provide the option, and set the default to TRUE to keep the return
consistent with prior versions of PerformanceAnalytics, but make no value
judgement on which approach is preferable.

\section{Background}{
 This function provides several estimation methods for
the Expected Shortfall (ES) (also called Expected Tail Loss (ETL)
or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)) of a return series and the Component ES
(ETL/CVaR) of a portfolio.

At a preset probability level denoted \eqn{c}, which typically is between 1
and 5 per cent, the ES of a return series is the negative value of the
expected value of the return when the return is less than its
\eqn{c}-quantile.  Unlike value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk has all
the properties a risk measure should have to be coherent and is a convex
function of the portfolio weights (Pflug, 2000).  With a sufficiently large
data set, you may choose to estimate ES with the sample average of all
returns that are below the \eqn{c} empirical quantile. More efficient
estimates of VaR are obtained if a (correct) assumption is made on the
return distribution, such as the normal distribution. If your return series
is skewed and/or has excess kurtosis, Cornish-Fisher estimates of ES can be
more appropriate. For the ES of a portfolio, it is also of interest to
decompose total portfolio ES into the risk contributions of each of the
portfolio components. For the above mentioned ES estimators, such a
decomposition is possible in a financially meaningful way.
